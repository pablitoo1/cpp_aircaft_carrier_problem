On the aircraft carrier, planes touch down and soar into the skies. To do this, they require
sole rights to the runway. The carrier has room for 10 planes. If there are fewer than 5
planes, landing aircraft get first dibs on the runway; otherwise, it's takeoff planes that get the
priority. If the number of planes surpasses 10, some of them remain airborne, patiently
awaiting their turn.
